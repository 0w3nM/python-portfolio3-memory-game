# Features
## Existing Features

![Image 1] Board generation
![Image 2] Input 
![Image 3] Validation and error-checking


## Future Features
 * Sequence is on the screen for less time.
 * Pass rate is raised to all guesses must be correct.
 * Only showing one digit at a time.

# Data Model

# Testing
Manual testing was carried out with:
* Code vaidated through PEP8 linter
* Inputs checked for validity by testing, numbers that are not within limits and inputing strings instead of numbers
* Tested on both local and Heroku terminal

## Bugs

## Validator Testing
* No errors reported through PEP8online.com
